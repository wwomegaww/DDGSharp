Team Motivator

When your team does well and gets kills, this script congratulates them
Sentences are random and should be a few thousand of variations.

A few examples:
gj
wow nice1
wp m8 ;P
It adds the smileys randomly at the end and also some beggining parts.
This script also says a greeting message in all chat, also a bit random:
gl, good luck, hf, have fun, gl and have fun.
etc...
